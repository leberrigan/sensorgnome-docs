  :alt: A finished Sensorgnome, ready to be deployed.

Introduction
------------
SensorGnomes are an essential component of the `Motus Wildlife Tracking System <https://motus.org/>`_. These devices act as radio receivers in a world-wide network, listening to radio transmitters that have been deployed on birds, bats, and insects by researchers trying to answer questions about movements on multiple scales.

The SensorGnome was originally designed at the Phil Taylor Lab at Acadia University and is now available for sale by `Compudata <https://compudata.ca/sensorgnome/>`_ and `RFS Scientific <https://www.rfsscientific.com/>`_.

Here I explain how to build one of these devices yourself.

See `Sensorgnome.org <https://sensorgnome.org/>`_ for more information.
